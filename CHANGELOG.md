# Changelog

All notable changes to Fractadyne. Versioning is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (Cargo) plus an
auto-incrementing **build** number (bumped by `build.rs` on every recompile) shown as
`v0.1.0 (build N)` in the title bar, Help menu, and exported image metadata.

The project enters tracked versioning at **0.1.0**; entries below summarize the state
at that point and changes after it.

## 0.1.0

Baseline for tracked versioning. Notable capabilities already present:

- **Deep zoom** — arbitrary-precision center, df64 reference orbit, df32 GPU
  perturbation with Zhuoran rebasing, hybrid direct/perturbation crossover; clean to
  ~10²²×. Generalized to Multibrot 3/4/5 and Tricorn in both Mandelbrot and Julia modes.
- **Fractal variety** — 10 escape-time families with per-fractal info panels.
- **Dual linked view** (Mandelbrot ↔ Julia) with per-view reference caches, Julia pin.
- **High-res export** — tiled PNG / OpenEXR with reloadable metadata, gallery browser,
  background rendering, progress + cancel.
- **UI** — combined menu/toolbar with icons, docked performance panel, animated
  zoom-home, fullscreen (Esc to exit), interactive orbit overlay (tapered gradient,
  racing-dot animation, normalized full-view mode), palette cycling animation.

### Added (post-baseline, this session)

- **Fractadyne branding & theme** — a dark "deep-space" UI theme with cyan/magenta
  accents (selection, links, hovered widgets), a painted brand mark + wordmark in the
  top bar, and a procedural window/taskbar icon.
- **Animated 3D relief lighting** — "Rotate light" spins the relief light direction over
  time (shares the Speed slider), alongside the animated distance glow and palette cycling.

- **Auto-incrementing build versioning** + this changelog; version shown in the title
  bar, Help menu, and export metadata.
- **Randomized palette mode** — palette animation can synthesize and continuously morph
  random gradients instead of cycling a fixed preset. Gradients are **harmonious** (one
  base hue + gentle analogous excursion + smooth dark→bright→dark arc), not clashing.
- **Scripting** — keyframe camera tours (center + zoom over time, eased), loadable from
  TOML, with a built-in demo/benchmark tour.
- **Benchmark** — runs a fixed scripted tour while sampling FPS, CPU ms, GPU ms, and
  peak RAM, then reports aggregates for comparing builds and machines. Report includes
  host **system info** (CPU brand/cores/cache, GPU, VRAM). Runnable headless via
  `fractadyne --benchmark [--out PATH]` for automated evaluation.
- **Headless render** — `fractadyne --render --out IMG [view options]` renders a single
  fractal image (fractal/center/zoom/size/ss/iter/julia/palette) and exits, for
  debugging and automated golden-image checks.
- **Release build** — `[profile.release]` tuned to build under this machine's memory
  limit (no debuginfo, no LTO). Optimized numerics: bignum reference recompute ~8×
  faster (374 ms → 45 ms), avg CPU ~7.6× faster. Build counter is now shared across
  debug/release profiles (`.build_seq` at the workspace root) so it stays monotonic.

- **Unlimited deep zoom (floatexp δ)** — the GPU perturbation delta now uses a floatexp
  representation (df32 mantissa + i32 exponent) past ~1e28×, removing the f32 exponent
  wall that broke rendering around 1e31–1e32×. Hybrid by depth (direct → df32
  perturbation → floatexp perturbation) so the common range keeps full speed; floatexp
  (~1.7× per-iteration cost) engages only when needed. Depth is now limited by the
  center-coordinate precision (which grows as you zoom) and the iteration budget.

- **Bookmarks / presets** — save the current view (full precision) and jump back to it
  instantly. Bookmarks menu + ★ toolbar button + a Manage… window (add/name/list/delete);
  persisted to `bookmarks.toml` in the config dir.

- **Distance-estimate relief lighting** — optional 3D/embossed shading from the
  fractal's derivative (`dz/dc`), tracked in floatexp so it works at any zoom depth
  (direct + perturbation paths; holomorphic families). Coloring-panel toggle + light
  angle/relief sliders; `--light` CLI flag; persisted. Iteration texture is now
  RGBA32F (the slope normal rides alongside the iteration value).
- **Distance-estimate glow (+ animation)** — bright distance-contour bands that densify
  into glowing filaments near the boundary, from the derivative magnitude (distance
  estimate). "Distance glow" toggle + Glow/Band-width sliders + "Animate glow" (flows
  the bands). `--de` CLI flag; persisted. Works at any depth (verified at 1e8×).

### Fixed (post-baseline, this session)

- **Deep zoom lost on quit/restart (uniform screen after relaunch)** — the auto-saved
  session stored the center as `f64`, so restoring a deep view truncated the coordinate
  to ~16 digits → a wrong location → uniform. The session now persists the center as a
  full-precision decimal string (like bookmarks/exports) and restores via `parse_bf`,
  falling back to `f64` for old session files. Also fixed the autosave debounce, which
  reset its timer every frame so an animating palette offset blocked the idle save
  (it now saves ~every second). Plus **multi-scale reference search**: the perturbation
  reference picker sampled a single coarse grid over the full view, which on a wide
  window at deep zoom landed between the thin filaments → a useless reference → uniform;
  it now samples several scales concentrated toward the center.
- **Uniform render at extreme depth on a large window** — the GPU-watchdog budget
  (texels × iterations) was kept by *clamping the iteration count*; on a big window
  (>~1.2 Mpx, i.e. maximized or with Windows display scaling) at very deep zoom that
  capped iterations well below what the detail needs, so the whole view escaped
  "late"/never and rendered as flat interior. Now the budget is met by reducing the
  iteration-texture *resolution* (the color pass upscales it) while keeping the full
  iteration count — graceful softness instead of a blank. (`--render` was unaffected,
  which is why a bookmark looked detailed when exported but blank live.)
- **Uniform/blank render after a cold jump to deep zoom (bookmark reload, Open view,
  `--render`)** — `best_reference` ranked candidate reference points using `f64`
  coordinates, which all collapse to the same value at deep zoom, so the search
  defaulted to the view center; if that sat in a fast-escape gap it was a poor
  reference → glitchy/uniform. Gradual zoom hid this by carrying a good reference
  chosen at shallower depth. Reference candidates are now scored in **arbitrary
  precision** (`orbit_length_bf`, scan-capped), so cold jumps find a good reference at
  any depth. (Confirmed the bookmark *coordinate* itself round-trips to ~1e-79 — far
  sub-pixel — so it was never an imprecision; added round-trip tests as guards.)
- **Soft "impressionist" frames while zooming deep** — the high-precision reference
  orbit was only refreshed once the view *settled*, so during motion a stale /
  out-of-view / under-precise reference made the perturbation blotchy until you paused.
  It now also refreshes *during* motion when out of view or under-precise, throttled
  adaptively (~2.5× the last recompute's duration) so it stays sharp without stalling
  the frame-rate (smooth on the release build; throttle widens automatically on debug).
- **Julia deep-zoom rebasing** — rebasing reset `δz = z_full`, valid only when
  `reference[0] = 0` (Mandelbrot). Julia orbits start at `Z₀ = ref_point ≠ 0`, so every
  rebase offset the perturbation and corrupted deep Julia renders. Now rebases to
  `δz = z_full − reference[0]` (a no-op for Mandelbrot).
